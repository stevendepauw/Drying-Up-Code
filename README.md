# Drying-Up-Code

##Description

Was given the website wth lots of unnecessary repetitive code that also wasnt using any sort of semantics at all. I cleaned up the HTML to include semantic tags and got rid of repeated css styles that could be combined instead of retyped over and over and shortened the css by about 50 lines of code.
